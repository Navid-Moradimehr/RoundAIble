- **Windows, macOS, Linux**: Full cross-platform support
- **Offline Capability**: Local model support via Ollama
- **Secure Architecture**: Proprietary software with built-in security

## üèóÔ∏è How It Works

### **1. Workflow Design**
Users create workflows by connecting different node types:
- **Input Node**: Defines the coding task (new code, modifications, bug fixes)
- **Reasoning Agents**: AI models that generate code solutions
- **Critic Nodes**: AI models that evaluate and score the generated code
- **RoundAIble Node**: Central orchestrator that manages the competition

### **2. Code Generation Process**
1. **Task Definition**: User specifies requirements in the input node
2. **Agent Competition**: Multiple AI agents generate code simultaneously
3. **Code Analysis**: Each agent's solution is analyzed by critic nodes
4. **Scoring & Ranking**: Solutions are scored and ranked based on quality
5. **Winner Selection**: The best solution is identified and presented

### **3. Real-time Monitoring**
- **Live Chat Interface**: Monitor agent interactions in real-time
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual indicators of workflow progress
- **Result Display**: Comprehensive results panel with code, scores, and feedback

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### **System Requirements**
- **Operating System**: Windows 10+, macOS 10.13+, or Ubuntu 18.04+
- **Memory**: 4GB RAM minimum (8GB recommended)
- **Storage**: 500MB available disk space
- **Network**: Internet connection for cloud AI models

### **Quick Start**
1. **Download**: Get the latest release for your platform
2. **Install**: Run the installer and follow the setup wizard
3. **Configure**: Add your API keys for cloud AI services
4. **Launch**: Start creating your first workflow

### **Development Setup**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/roundaible.git
cd roundaible

# Install dependencies
npm install
cd backend && npm install
cd ../frontend && npm install

# Start development servers
npm run dev
```



## üîß Configuration

### **API Keys & Model Setup**
For detailed instructions on setting up API keys and local models, see the [API Setup Guide](API_SETUP_GUIDE.md).

RoundAIble supports multiple AI providers:
- **OpenAI**: GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o
- **Anthropic**: Claude 3, Claude 2
- **Google**: Gemini Pro, Gemini Flash
- **HuggingFace**: Thousands of open-source models
- **Local Models**: Via Ollama (privacy-focused, offline capable)

### **Environment Configuration**
Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:
```env
# Server Configuration
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development

# API Keys (optional for local models)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_key
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your_hf_key
```

## üìä Workflow Examples

### **Example 1: Simple Code Generation**
1. Add an Input Node with your coding task
2. Connect to multiple Reasoning Agent nodes (API, Local, HuggingFace)
3. Connect Reasoning Agents to Critic nodes
4. Run the workflow to get multiple solutions with scores

### **Example 2: Code Review Workflow**
1. Input Node with existing code
2. Reasoning Agents analyze the code
3. Critic nodes provide detailed feedback
4. Get comprehensive code review with improvement suggestions

### **Example 3: Bug Fix Workflow**
1. Input Node with buggy code and error messages
2. Multiple agents attempt different fixes
3. Critics evaluate the quality of each fix
4. Select the best solution based on scores

## üîí Security & Privacy

### **Data Protection**
- **Local Processing**: Ollama models run entirely on your machine
- **Encrypted Storage**: Sensitive data is encrypted at rest
- **Secure Communication**: HTTPS for all API communications
- **No Data Collection**: RoundAIble doesn't collect or store your code

### **API Security**
- **Key Management**: Secure storage of API keys
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in protection against API abuse
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API failures
- **Fallback Options**: Local models as backup for cloud services

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

#### **Ollama Connection Issues**
```bash
# Check if Ollama is running
ollama list

# Restart Ollama service
ollama serve

# Test model availability
ollama run codellama:7b "Hello, world!"
```

#### **API Key Problems**
- Verify API keys are correctly entered
- Check API key permissions and quotas
